          Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease.
          A newly identified coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a worldwide pandemic, called COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "coronavirus" actually refers to a family of viruses that causes many different types
          of diseases, including the common cold. COVID-19 is a "novel coronavirus," which means it’s a
          new disease unfamiliar to scientists and doctors. Its name is actually a mash-up of the words
          "corona" (CO); corona means "crown" in Latin (coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes
          on their surface), "virus" (VI), and "disease" (D). The "19" comes from the year 2019, when the
          disease was first detected.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was first identified back in December 2019 by the World Health Organization,
          following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.

    <p id="hidden" class="content_container3" style="color: black">Fun fact #1: The word "Corona" was taken from the
      Latin word for Crown. As the protruding ends of the virus look like crowns, the virus is named the Coronavirus.

      <h2>How does it spread?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Coronavirus is mostly spread through the air, when people are in close contact with each other. This is
        why it’s very important that we socially distance from other people, and wear a mask. Wearing a mask over
        your mouth and nose helps to stop your water droplets from reaching other people. If we all wear masks, we
        all keep our droplets to ourselves!
      </p>
      <p>
        COVID-19 spreads through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or
        sneezes.
        These droplets do not travel far, but instead fall onto the ground or onto surfaces (such as tables and
        chairs.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, direct contact with these droplets will also result in the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, it is
        important
        to practice good hygiene. (eg. Washing hands with soap)

    <h2>What can you do?</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>If you feel sick</h4>
    <p>
      If you are feeling unwell, stay at home and call your local clinic or doctor. Explain your symptoms to them
      over the phone.
      If you happen to experience severe shortness of breath or have a very high fever, seek medical care at a
      hospital.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Avoid close contact with others</h4>
    <p>
      Since COVID-19 spreads from person to person, if an infected person coughs or sneezes, their droplets can
      infect nearby people.
      Therefore, it is important to avoid close contact with others. (Hence the 1 metre social distancing rule) It
      is also important to
      wear a mask when going out of the house.


    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Practice good hygiene</h4>
    <p>
      COVID-19 can survive for hours or even days on some surfaces. Touching a contaminated surface and then
      touching your face is one of the
      ways to become infected. With that in mind, it is important to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="learn-lists">Wash your hands with soap and water frequently and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds.
        (Especially after being in public places and touching door handles, shopping carts or even elevator buttons)
      </li>
      <li class="learn-lists">If soap and water are not available immediately, use hand sanitizer with at least 60%
        alcohol.</li>
      <li class="learn-lists">Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, especially with unwashed hands.</li>

      <p>Most people who catch COVID-19 do get better, and even then their illness is usually mild.
        As a matter of fact, few kids have even been affected. However, if you do catch COVID-19,
        you might just have a dry cough, a fever and shortness of breath. Just like when you have a cold,
        the best treatment is to stay in bed - and away from anyone who might catch it from you! (Example,
        your grandparents. Older people tend to be more at risk for catching COVID-19.) You might not
        even know you have it, so keep washing your hands, just in case.

        There are experts who are working hard to figure out how to prevent people from getting the disease - and how
        to help them recover if they catch it. Dozens of drugs (medicines) have already been tested around the world.
        The
        good news is that some scientists have been successful with creating a vaccine. Hopefully, these vaccines will
        help
        us return to a normal life soon.
